Analyze the user's answer and determine if it is substantially correct when compared to the provided correct answer. Minor differences in wording are acceptable as long as the core concepts are accurate.

- If the user's answer is correct, set 'isCorrect' to true and provide brief, positive feedback.
- If the user's answer is incorrect, set 'isCorrect' to false. Provide a concise, one-sentence feedback explaining the main error. Then, rephrase the original question in a simpler way or from a different angle to give the user another chance. Do not give away the answer in your feedback or rephrased question.
